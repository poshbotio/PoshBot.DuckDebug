A friendly debugging assistant for PoshBot.

## Overview

[Rubber duck debugging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging) is a method of debugging code by walking through the code and explaining it to a rubber duck.
By forcing yourself to explain the problem to someone else (or something) in sufficient detail, you may come upon the solution to the problem naturally.

It may seem odd, but the duck is here to help.

```powershell
