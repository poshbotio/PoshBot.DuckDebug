    PoshBot.DuckDebug

SHORT DESCRIPTION
    A friendly debugging assistant for PoshBot.

LONG DESCRIPTION
    Rubber duck debugging is a method of debugging code by walking through the code
    and explaining it to a rubber duck. By forcing yourself to explain the problem
    to someone else (or something) in sufficient detail, you may come upon the
    solution to the problem naturally.

    It may seem odd, but the duck is here to help.
